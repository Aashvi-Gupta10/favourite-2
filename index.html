        <p> My hobby is reading interesting and fun books in my free time. Whenever i go to home from to my school I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 11 years old and is in 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is a very good habit which can make me complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge inspiration and instructions. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life. </p>
